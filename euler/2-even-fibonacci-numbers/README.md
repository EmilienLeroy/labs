# Even Fibonacci numbers
## Problem 

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Run solution

I have resolve this trouble with two solutions. One with simple variable and one with a vector. To run each solution just use there commands :

```sh
# version with simple variable.
$ make simple 

# version with vector
make vector
```
